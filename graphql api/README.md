### Setup

1. Use and setup the project with `yarn`.
2. The project is written in Typescript...
## Problem Description:

Create A basic Express application, that makes a CRUD operation (create, read, update, delete) using SQLite database, document and publish your endpoints using postman.
In this project, youâ€™ll build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a Movie Listing Application.

## Implementation:

IMPLEMENTED AUTHORIZATION AND AUTHENTICATION: PROTECTED ALL ROUTES. ONLY THE LOGGED-IN USERS CAN PERFORM THE FOLLOWING OPERATIONS

- You can add a Movies.
- You can edit Movies.
- You can delete a Movies

## NOTE
- Users that are not authenticated can browse through  Movies on the app

## How I completed this project?

- The application is able to perform.
  - `GET` Request which returns all the data in your database
  - `POST` Request which adds data to your database
  - `PUT` Request which updates fields of a particular data using the id in database
  - `DELETE` Request which removes a particular data from your database using the id
- Hosted the application on Heroku.
- Data format example: This show the model for users and the Movies added/created by the user

```
[

 {
   fullname: 'john doe',
   username:'Yourusername'
   email: 'john@example.com', // no duplicates allowed.
   password:"ofyource",
 }
 
   Movies:[
   {
    title: 'Avengers',
    description :'Avengers is an interesting movie'
